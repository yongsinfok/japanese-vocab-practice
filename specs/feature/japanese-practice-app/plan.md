# Implementation Plan: Japanese Practice App

## Technical Context

| Category | Technology/Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Programming Language | C# | Confirmed |
| UI Framework | WPF | Confirmed |
| Data Handling | System.Text.Json | Confirmed |
| Persistence | JSON files | Confirmed |
| AI Integration | Local LLM | NEEDS CLARIFICATION |
| LLM API/SDK | TBD | NEEDS CLARIFICATION |
| Project Structure | TBD | NEEDS CLARIFICATION |

## Constitution Check

| Principle | Assessment | Status |
|---|---|---|
| I. Code Quality | Adherence to C#/.NET best practices and style guides will be required. | ✅ Compliant |
| II. Testing Standards | Unit tests for business logic (e.g., question generation) and UI interactions will be implemented. | ✅ Compliant |
| III. User Experience | A simple and intuitive WPF interface will be designed. | ✅ Compliant |
| IV. Performance | The use of a local LLM and efficient data handling will be critical for performance. | ✅ Compliant |

## Gates Evaluation

No constitutional violations identified at this stage.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

The following items need to be researched to resolve the "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items in the Technical Context:

1.  **Local LLM Selection:** Identify and evaluate suitable local LLMs for question generation (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Phi).
2.  **LLM Integration:** Determine the best method for integrating the selected LLM with a C# application (e.g., REST API, SDK).
3.  **Project Structure:** Define a suitable project structure for a WPF application (e.g., MVVM).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

1.  **Data Model (`data-model.md`):** Define the structure for storing questions, user progress, and settings in JSON files.
2.  **API Contracts (`/contracts`):** If the LLM is accessed via an API, define the request and response contracts.
3.  **Quickstart (`quickstart.md`):** Create a guide for setting up the development environment.
