# Feature Specification: Japanese Language Practice Application

**Feature Branch**: `feature/japanese-practice-app`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a windows application that can help me practice my learned japanese language..."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Vocabulary Practice (Priority: P1)

As a Japanese language learner, I want to practice vocabulary organized by weeks, so that I can reinforce what I've learned in a structured way.

**Why this priority**: This is a core feature that provides immediate value for vocabulary building.

**Independent Test**: A user can successfully complete a vocabulary practice session for a single week and view their results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I have vocabulary data for "Week 1", **When** I select "Week 1" in the Vocabulary section and start a session, **Then** the application displays a random Japanese word from that week and prompts me for the meaning.
2.  **Given** I am in a vocabulary practice session, **When** I enter the correct meaning for a word, **Then** the application confirms it's correct and presents the next random word.
3.  **Given** I am in a vocabulary practice session, **When** I enter an incorrect meaning, **Then** the application informs me it's incorrect and displays the correct answer.

### User Story 2 - Grammar Practice (Priority: P2)

As a Japanese language learner, I want to practice grammar points with AI-generated questions, so that I can test my understanding in different contexts.

**Why this priority**: This feature provides a more advanced and dynamic way to learn grammar beyond simple memorization.

**Independent Test**: A user can successfully complete a grammar practice session for a single week.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I have grammar data for "Week 1", **When** I select "Week 1" in the Grammar section, **Then** the application presents a question related to a random grammar point from that week.
2.  **Given** I am in a grammar practice session, **When** I provide the correct answer, **Then** the application confirms it's correct and presents the next question.
3.  **Given** I am in a grammar practice session, **When** I provide an incorrect answer, **Then** the application informs me it's incorrect and displays the correct answer.

### User Story 3 - Content Management (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to easily add and manage my own vocabulary and grammar content, so that I can customize the application to my personal learning path.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to personalize the app, increasing its long-term utility.

**Independent Test**: A user can add a new vocabulary word, and it appears in the corresponding practice session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am in the content management section, **When** I choose to add a new vocabulary item to "Week 1", **Then** the system provides a form for the Japanese word, its reading, and its meaning.
2.  **Given** I have added a new vocabulary item, **When** I start a practice session for that week, **Then** the new item can appear in the session.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects a practice week that contains no data? (The system should display a user-friendly message.)
- How does the application handle incorrect input types, such as numbers where text is expected? (The system should provide clear validation and error messages.)
- What is the behavior when the external AI service for grammar questions is unavailable? (The system should inform the user and gracefully disable the grammar practice feature temporarily.)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The system MUST provide two distinct practice modes: "词汇" (Vocabulary) and "文法" (Grammar).
-   **FR-002**: The system MUST allow content to be organized into weekly sets (e.g., Week 1, Week 2).
-   **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select one or more weeks for a practice session.
-   **FR-004**: In Vocabulary mode, the system MUST display a Japanese term and prompt the user for its meaning.
-   **FR-005**: In Grammar mode, the system MUST generate a practice question based on a selected grammar point.
-   **FR-006**: The system MUST provide immediate feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
-   **FR-007**: If an answer is incorrect, the system MUST display the correct answer.
-   **FR-008**: The order of questions within a practice session MUST be randomized.
-   **FR-009**: The system MUST provide an in-app graphical user interface (GUI) for users to manage their vocabulary and grammar data.
-   **FR-010**: The application MUST run on the Windows operating system.
-   **FR-011**: The system MUST generate multiple-choice questions for grammar practice.

### Key Entities

-   **PracticeSet**: A collection of learning items, identified by a name (e.g., "Week 1"). It can contain either Vocabulary Items or Grammar Items.
-   **VocabularyItem**: Represents a single vocabulary entry. Contains the Japanese term (e.g., "天気"), its reading (e.g., "てんき"), and its meaning (e.g., "天气").
-   **GrammarItem**: Represents a single grammar point. Contains the grammar rule (e.g., "~ずに"), its meaning (e.g., "没有做~"), and an example sentence.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

-   Users are running a supported and stable version of the Windows operating system.
-   Users have a stable internet connection for the AI-powered grammar question generation feature.

### Dependencies

-   The grammar practice feature requires access to an external AI/LLM service to generate questions.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: A user can start a practice session for any selected week within 3 clicks from the application's home screen.
-   **SC-002**: 95% of user-submitted answers receive feedback (correct or incorrect) in under 500 milliseconds.
-   **SC-003**: A user can successfully add a new vocabulary or grammar item to a weekly set in under 30 seconds using the in-app GUI.
-   **SC-004**: The system must be able to load and manage at least 1,000 learning items without a noticeable degradation in performance.
