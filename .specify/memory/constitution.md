# Japanese Practice JS Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable. All contributions must adhere to the project's established style guide and linting rules. Code should be well-documented, especially for complex logic and public APIs.

### II. Testing Standards
All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by comprehensive tests. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for critical user flows. A high level of test coverage is expected and will be enforced through CI checks. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All UI components and user interactions should adhere to the project's design system and style guide. Changes affecting the UI must be reviewed for consistency and usability.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must be fast and responsive. Performance metrics, such as page load times and API response latency, will be monitored. Code that may impact performance should be benchmarked and optimized.

## Development Workflow

All new development must follow the feature branch workflow. Pull requests are required for all code changes and must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before being merged into the main branch. All CI checks, including tests and linting, must pass before a pull request can be merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the primary document guiding the development of this project. Any proposed changes to these principles must be documented, discussed with the team, and approved before being incorporated. All development activities are expected to comply with this constitution.
